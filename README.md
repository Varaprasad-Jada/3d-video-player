# 3d-video-player
This is a client-side web application built with pure JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to load a Side-by-Side (SBS) 3D video file (e.g., MP4) and convert the frames in real-time into a selectable Anaglyph 3D format (Red/Cyan, Green/Magenta, or Blue/Yellow), suitable for viewing with passive 3D glasses.
